# Getting Started

Welcome to GameSpark's series of tutorials created to help you understand the basics of the platform and its relationship with the SDKs.

Through this series of tutorials you will be able to create a game that authenticates and registers players, saves and uses persistent data, has a leaderboard, achievements and virtual goods. After following the tutorials in order you will have a firm understanding of the fundamentals in using a GameSparks as a back-end and you will have the confidence to explore the rest of the platform having learned to use the test harness, cloud code and management of events and players which will allow you to understand and follow more complex and advanced features of the platform.

The tutorials are in order, so we strongly suggest that you follow them in order to have a complete fundamental understanding of the platform. Each tutorial introduces important pieces that come together to allow you to debug and achieve your development aims on the Platform and on the SDKs.

The Getting Started tutorials are:

  * *Creating your Game* - Teaches you to create your first game on the platform and set up your SDK so you're ready to start using GameSparks.
  * *Using Authentication* - How to register and authenticate players as well as introducing the test harness.
  * *Using Cloud Code* - Creating events on the platform and linking them to some logic using Cloud Code and calling them through the SDKs.
  * *Creating a Leaderboard* - Creating a leaderboard, uploading a score to it and setting up listeners in the SDKs.
  * *Creating a Virtual Good* - Creating a virtual good and using currency to buy it through the SDKs.

The tutorials are split into two parts. The first being the platform side of the implementation, the setup and use of the features which can be used through the GameSparks API on any supported SDK. The second part consists of using the API on the SDK which uses the features set up in the first part of the tutorial.
